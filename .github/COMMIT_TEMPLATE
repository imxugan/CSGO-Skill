type(scope): Imperative mood subject line

Body text describing changes goes here. Note the blank like between the
subject line and body text. You probably know the 50/72 rule, but since
everyone is different, and most probably are reading commit messages on
GitHub instead of in the terminal, I typically prefer wrapping at 100
characters. But don't let me tell you what to do, wrap at your own will!

The subject line starts with a specific "type." See the comment block
below for what types you have at your disposal. In (parentheses) is the
scope. It should be a single word that describes where the changes are
mostly located. Again, see the comment block below for more info.

You are encouraged to break up the description into paragraphs. It
improves readability for longer commit messages. I especially enjoy
hovering over the commit subject line link in the history on GitHub and
it displays the full message as alt text, and it looks so nice when
broken into paragraphs!

- Use bullets to make rapid points!
- Kapow! Bullets go fast, no time for blank lines!
