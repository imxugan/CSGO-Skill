### Before you continue
You can submit issues for pretty much anything from bugs to feature requests to questions. When submitting a feature request, just make sure you accurately describe your idea. If asking a question, just check that it hasn't already been asked/ answered.

Please include a category in the issue title, like this: `[BUG]`, `[FEATURE]`, or `[QUESTION]`

Before submitting a bug issue, please do the following.
- [ ] Verify this happens on the most recent version of the application, or the currently published website.
- [ ] Search both open and closed issues to see if this has already been submitted.

Issues describing the same problem and the same steps to reproduce will be closed instantly. Multiple issues describing the SAME problem, but with UNIQUE steps to reproduce are ALLOWED.

After you've done that, delete this section and fill in the sections below.
