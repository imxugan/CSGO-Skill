Smoke utility RATED FOR SOLOQ Tested 3 times on every tick server (64nd128):
Rated as in *Bold*:
-Usefull = 5
-Good = 6
-Handly = 6
-Bad = 3

1.- (0:20): Pretty useless and dangerous if you dont have mid control. It is exposed asf, but you can throw it pretty quicky and it doesn't take a lot to pop up. 
Handly for A retakes from L, for example. 
No tick difference

2.- (0:33): No explain, it is good enough. Jumpbind Needed
No tick difference 


3.- (0:49): *Handly*, a very deep B smoke will make them fall back, but it can be good if you want to keep being defensive. You can get it to be a non deep smoke if you throw it a little bit to the right (http://i.imgur.com/m6KWWZN.jpg)
No tick difference

4.- (0:56) Usefull It covers the 100% of connnector, 0 gaps and really fast.
In 128tick leaves a little gap but it isn't deadly.

5.- (1:11) Good for retakes, no gap.
No tick difference

6.- (1:25) *Good*, same thing has 5th
No tick difference

7.- (1:40) *Bad*, holy shit this was a pain in the ass to recreate, pretty high chance to hit the right wall, unconsistent asf.
128tick: It leaves a HUGE gap (http://i.imgur.com/q6EK6M5.png) in the left side from window. 
64tick: Same thing but in the right side (http://i.imgur.com/xtLP6E7.jpg) 

8.- (1:55) Good this one is amazing, gotta use it alot from now

9.- (2:02) It seems to be pretty good, but it leaves A HUGE FUCKING GAP

*Handly*, can be useful if you can defend that gap. 
No tick difference

10.- (2:11) Good a bit unconsistent, but the rest is really good, no gaps.
Tick difference, 128 tick will go way further

11.- (2:27) BAD SMOK DON USE YAR MATHHER N0B (jk its 10/10, *Usefull*)
No tick difference

12.- (2:36) ^

ADVICE: From now i've doing this for more than a hour and half (timed.) so sorry if something is wrong, im lazy asf.

13.- (2:47) Handly pretty good, but getting the position is a bit tricky.
Tick difference, 128 tick will hit the the sky (lol) and will stop in site (http://i.imgur.com/5PYpIxz.jpg) so it isn't broken in 128tick at all.

17.- (3:46) Handly Pretty unconsistent, not to many references to throw, the rest is good enough.
