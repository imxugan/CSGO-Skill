The Smoke Grenade instantly deploys after a few seconds and covers a wide cylindrical area with the upper and lower corners being slightly clipped. Good for providing light-of-sight cover to cross open areas or to hold back rushes for a few seconds. Putting a smoke down in a tight corridor, and then flashing yourself to the other side could be extremely effective to taking a group of enemies by surprise.",
