This page doubles as a release list and change log, with everything you'd expect from both. Pictures, videos, and loads of text. It may look pretty small now, but I plan on continuously adding to the CSGO Skill project and expanding this list.

The next upcoming release is always listed at the top and clearly labeled. Past releases are below it and read-only, typos and all. If you want more information on the next release to come, click the title link. During development, features are likely to be added, changed, pushed back or removed entirely. In other words, take the feature goals with a grain of salt and don't expect everything listed to be added in the final release. Sometimes I may chose to deliberately exclude final features from the goal list for a variety of reasons, maybe because I didn't plan on implementing it originally or just to surprise people.
