# Welcome to the CSGO Skill wiki!
This wiki mostly just describes design aspects of the Website and App. Currently, this project is under heavy development, so probably everything here will be changing constantly. I don't personally recommend reading any pages unless you are seriously interested in the project and how it works, and would like to contribute to it. If you just happened across this wiki, you may not have any use for the stuff here.

# Maintained Pages
Although there are lots of links in the side bar, most of them are not maintained. The links on this page, however, are constantly maintained and up-to-date.

> ### [Projects](Projects)
> This is where the details for all releases are located. New releases start with a task list and turn into change logs when they are done. Check here to see a breakdown for features of releases.

> ### Design Goals for [Website](Site-Design-Goals) and [App](App-Design-Goals)
> Here you can see the thought process behind how the UI looks and functions. I'm no professional designer, but I know what looks good from a visual and functional standpoint.

> ### [Database & Tracking](Database-&-Tracking)
> This contains a lot of information about the structure of the database for the website. Also details the tracking system and how it works.
