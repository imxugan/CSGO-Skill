Some useful email addresses for those interested.

These are public emails owned and operated by a "team." Feel free to send emails to them, except the robot.

> ### devteam@csgo-skill.com
> For all inquiries about the CSGO Skill project. Usually responds within 3 days. Since you're on GitHub, however, you should consider opening an Issue instead, as responses will be significantly faster.

> ### support@flare-esports.net
> *Currently unsupported. Inquiries may not get a response. Planned to operate at a future date.*

> ### skillbot@csgo-skill.com
> Sends friendly messages to CSGO Skill users. It's very shy, so emails sent to it will be ignored.
