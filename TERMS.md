### Note to Contributors
Please don't stress about these terms! I'll do my absolute best to make sure you don't break any rules. In the end, if I accept a bad contribution, it will mostly be my fault. I don't want you to worry so much that you don't contribute, but I have to supply this agreement to keep both of us safe.

Making this project open-source has been a real headache, but I'm glad I did and I can't wait to see what you contribute to it!

# CSGO Skill User Agreement
Last updated: January 16th, 2018

The CSGO Skill User Agreement is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations as a user or contributor to CSGO Skill. To make things simple, we wrote these terms to be as short and clear as possible. Please read this in full, it should only take about 2 minutes.

"We" refers, collectively, to the owner of the CSGO Skill repository and its collaborators. Contributors do NOT equal collaborators. Collaborators can only be invited by the owner of the repository. The repository is located at github.com/almic/CSGO-Skill.

#### A. Your Account
By completing the registration process with a valid Steam account and email address, you become a user of CSGO Skill and create a CSGO Skill account. You are responsible for your CSGO Skill account and it's security. We will securely retain only your email address, all other information is either publicly available through the Steam Web API or provided by you. You may not become a user if you are under the age of 13. This project is not intended for children under 13 and we will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

#### B. Affiliation with Steam
We *are not* endorsed or affiliated with Valve. We only play with Steam and follow their rules.

#### C. Contributions
This project is open-source and hosted by GitHub. The code is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), and the content is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/deed.en_US). You must agree with the [GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/) to make contributions.

We reserve the right to accept or deny any contributions for any reason. We will never intentionally accept contributions that would harm us or our users. We will do our best to avoid any situation that would make our contributors responsible for any harm. In short, don't stress about making bad contributions!

To make things go smoothly, you should review the [Steam Subscriber Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/) and the [Steam Web API Terms of Use](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms). This isn't required, but it will help you avoid making silly mistakes which force us to deny your contributions.

If your contributions are accepted, we will manually add your name to a credits section of the project. **Please do not add yourself to any credits sections!** You may request to be excluded from the credits by simply asking. By default, we will use the current username of your GitHub account. You can request a specific name to be used if you want. We reserve the right to deny names for any reason, and to not include your name in the credits if you fail to supply a suitable name.

#### D. Miscellaneous
We reserve the right to roll back, modify, license, distribute, and store your contributions in whatever way we want. We will accept contributions that you license yourself, as long as the code is substantial in quality and is under the MIT license, and any content is substantial in quality and under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

All this mumbo-jumbo basically lets us safely use your contribution in the project without risking harm to us, our users, and other contributors.

#### E. No Warranty
We provide this project in its entirety "as is," "with all faults" and "as available." We will not be liable for any damages what-so-ever resulting from this agreement or your use of this project. If you do not agree with any part of this agreement then your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using this project.

Because Valve.

#### F. Changes
We reserve the right to change this agreement, and you are responsible for regularly reviewing this agreement. Your continued use of this project after the effective date of such changes will constitute acceptance of and agreement to any such changes. If you don't agree with any such changes, or to any of the terms in this agreement, your only remedy is to discontinue using this project. We may suspend or discontinue the project at any time to you and/or to others, without notice.

#### G. Termination
We reserve the right to terminate any CSGO Skill account for any reason and without notice.
