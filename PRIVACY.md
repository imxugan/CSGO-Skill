# Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 9th, 2018

We respect the privacy of our visitors, users, and contributors. We have adopted this short and clear privacy policy to better inform people about how this project collects, stores, and uses information.

"We" refers, collectively, to the owner of the CSGO Skill repository and its collaborators. Contributors do NOT equal collaborators. Collaborators can only be invited by the owner of the repository. The repository is located at github.com/almic/CSGO-Skill.

## Information We Collect and How It's Used
#### Website Interactions
The website collects some non-personally identifiable information. This includes browser type, language preference, and the date and time of each request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This is only to help us better understand how people use the website, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.

#### Users
This project integrates the Steam OpenID login service. This allows us to use the Steam Web API to provide the services of the project. Information collected includes your online status, user stats in CSGO, and any publicly available profile information like your user name and profile picture. You do not need to create an account to access some features, including limited stat tracking. Simply click the "Sign in through Steam" button on the website, and public stat tracking will be enabled, although at a limited scale.

If you choose to create an account, we require only three things from you. A custom user name to help us identify you in the project, a Steam ID to offer our services, and an email address to contact you about the state of your profile and other things you request to be contacted about. You may give more information if you want, and this may include "User Personal Information."

"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name, an email address, a real name, or a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”

#### Contributors
This project is open-source and licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php). The project is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/flare-org/CSGO-Skill). If you contribute to this project, you have the option to provide a name so that we may give you credit for your contributions. This is optional. You must request to be excluded from such credit if you desire. By default we will use your GitHub name, but you may provide a different name.

#### Use of Information
We do not sell, trade, or rent any information.

We need a user name, your email address, and Steam ID to create your account.

We use your Steam ID to track publicly available stats and display them, as well as to display your Steam profile picture in some places.

We use your email to communicate with you, if you say that's okay, and only for reasons you've said that's okay.

We limit our use of any information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.

## Cookies
The website uses cookies to make interactions with the service easier and more meaningful. These keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development. You can opt-out by disabling cookies in your browser. You will be unable to login and change account settings with cookies disabled.

## Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service to analyze user interactions with the project. It does not collect personally identifying information. This is only to help us improve the project.

## Children Under The Age of 13
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 may not use this project in any way, no exceptions. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are under the age of 13, we will have to take necessary actions such as closing your account and reporting it to Valve and GitHub so they may take necessary actions as well. We are required by law to do this, so please don't take it personally.

## Opt-out
Users may opt-out of any services provided by the project. Some ways include but are not limited to disabling browser cookies, setting your Steam profile to be Private or Friends-Only, or simply not interacting with the project. The best way to opt-out is by closing your CSGO Skill account, setting your Steam profile to be Private or Friends-Only, and ceasing all interaction with the project.
