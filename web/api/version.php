 * the database version without affecting current users. When we are ready to
 * roll out a new version, we simply change this file and the new version is
 * officially released.
 *
 * The new version files should already be in the Database and on a timed release
 * in the app store if needed. We just wait for the app to update on the store
 * and publish the new `version.php` and boom, super smooth version change.
