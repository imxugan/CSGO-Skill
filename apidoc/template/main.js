/*
 apiDoc is used simply to combine all our api stuff into a neat json document, then we will eventually
 parse that into a static website by running this script with the api_data.json file.

 As you may have noticed, this "script" is only a comment block. That's because, for now, the default
 template is good enough for me. I do eventually plan on writing a simple script to generate a static
 website, probably using Jekyll for it's simplicity, which will be overall better than a one-page
 document, including full examples of objects and such by using special definitions and what-not.
