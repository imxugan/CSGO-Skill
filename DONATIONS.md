# Donations
This project survives on the charity of myself and others, instead of placing ads or requiring payment for features. You can help speed development by [donating via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/TheAlmic/1). Please leave a note stating you are donating for this project, and a name so I can give you credit.

## How your money will be spent
> ### Hosting the Website
> Server space isn't free. I host on Heroku, and it currently costs about $250/ year to run the site.

> ### Domain Registration
> Google is happily routing requests for www.csgo-skill.com for $1/ month. Not bad!

And that's pretty much it. Donations I receive will go 100% to maintaining the project. Extra cash will be saved for future projects or if the cost of this one increases.
